## Project Structure and Purpose

This project is well-organized with a clear structure that promotes maintainability and collaboration. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their purposes:

**Essential Files**

* `Makefile`: Automates the build process by providing instructions for compiling, testing, and packaging the project.
* `README.md`: Serves as the primary documentation for developers and users, explaining the project's overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and contributions guidelines. (This file!)
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the external Python packages and their versions required to run the project.
* `setup.py`: (Optional for Python projects) Facilitates installation, distribution, and metadata management using `pip`.

**Docker Integration**

* `Dockerfile`: Defines the instructions for creating a Docker image that contains all project dependencies, enabling reproducible builds and deployments.
* `.dockerignore`: Specifies files or patterns to exclude from the Docker image, preventing unnecessary content from being included.

  * `reports/figures/.gitkeep`: (Empty folder) Stores images, charts, and other visual representations of results.
  * `reports/logs/.gitkeep`: (Empty folder) Contains log files generated during training, evaluation, or other processes.
  * `reports/papers/.gitkeep`: (Empty folder) Holds project-related research papers or reports (if applicable).

**Source Code** (Folders):
  * `src/__init__.py`: An empty file to mark the `src` directory as a Python package (optional).
      * **Data** (Subfolder):
          * `src/data/__init__.py`: Empty file to mark the `data` subfolder as a package (optional).
